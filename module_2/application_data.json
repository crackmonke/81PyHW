Your application has unfortunately not been selected for a fellowship; however, you are considered eligible for the program. (Part of email from the admission office) This means I must now seek a lab that is willing to fund my doctoral studies. I have also heard that securing a fellowship in the 2nd round is exceptionally difficult; however, the department has decided to discontinue the 2nd round starting in 2026. Best of luck to future applicants."

I had a lot of experience in SLP related areas, but had a D in Stats when I first applied. I took another Stats course and got a B that I put down on the \"required courses\" section the second time round. In my gap year, I got a job as a Behaviour Interventionist, volunteered at a Brain Injury Society doing intake interviews with Brain Injury survivors, redid my letter of interest with a Career Advisor, and asked an SLP Alumni from U of A to write my reference letter. One of my referees wasn't able to get their reference letter in on time, and they still accepted my application with just 2 references. If you're applying to U of A for SLP my best advice is to job shadow as many SLPs as you can, try gaining work experience in related fields, and focus on your letter of interest and reference letters. Keep trying! If you don't get in this year, you'll probably get in next year!!"
