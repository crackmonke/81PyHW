# Grad Cafe Pipeline

This project provides a simple pipeline to download applicant data from an AWS S3 bucket and save a renamed copy locally.

*This README was written by GitHub Copilot.*

## Features

- Downloads `applicant_data.json` from the S3 bucket `grad-cafe-spg`
- Saves a renamed version as `applicant_data_SM.json`

## Requirements

Install dependencies using:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Ensure your AWS credentials are configured (e.g., via IAM role or AWS CLI).
2. Run the notebook [`grad_cafe_pipeline.ipynb`](grad_cafe_pipeline.ipynb).

The notebook will:
- Download the file from S3
- Save a renamed copy in your working directory
